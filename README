 The DRAM Rule matches the upper 21 bits of system address 
 with its Limit field. If it falls in the range, it is a hit.
 Accordingly an interleaving index among the nodes is computed.
 from DRAM INTERLEAVE LIST. 

 OUTPUT :  Type of Memory : DRAM or Memory-Mapped CFG

 TO DO : Plot the DRAM LIMITS to see if it is uniformly separated
 across the ranges.

 The interleave mode is used to identify the required offset
 to find the node involved as per the interleave index. 

 Output : Node ID [1:8]. I believe that the node id's are equivalent
 to smp cores. For M620, it should be maximum 2.

 TO DO : Plot the Node ID interleavings across various ranges
 to see if how nodes participate in interleaving separated across the ranges.

             
 MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS :

 There is a DRAM CONTROLLER VIEW OF THE MEMORY. 
 Memory registers : TOHM, TOLM defines the ranges which are visible to the Operating System. 

 			TOLM
 PCI_BUS NO     PCI_DEVICE_ID     PCI_FUNC    OFFSET
 1		12		  7		80h

 3:0 :This register contains bits 31 to 28 of an address one byte above the maximum
 DRAM memory below 4G that is usable by the operating system.

 			TOHM
 PCI_BUS NO     PCI_DEVICE_ID     PCI_FUNC    OFFSET
 1		12		  7		80h

 20:0 :This register contains bits 45:25 of an address one byte above the maximum
DRAM memory; above 4 GB that is usable by the operating system.

             iMC TARGET ADDRESS REGISTERS

The DRAM rule range is sub-divided between the channels of a node.  
Thus for N DRAM Rules and P channel, So total regions for complete
interleaving become  N+P

The TAD Rule Range Limit : [45:26] : Granularity : 64 MB

Output :
        Number of Socket Ways 
        Number of Channel Ways  

To DO : Check is socket wayness and channel is uniformly
interleaved across TAD Ranges.

Use the TAD Rule hit to index into the CHNILVOFFSET to
determine the channel id.

 if a rule hits, then the index is used to choose the offset from the 
 RIR Range Rank interleave Offset Register.
   
 Determine the RIR Rule hit index
 To DO : Check the Range interleaving across all the RIR_LIMIT ranges for uniformity.

	  if So get the RANK_CNT.
          map logical Rank to physical Rank.

          and number of Column Address Pins
